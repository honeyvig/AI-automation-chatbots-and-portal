=================
Here’s a Python script outline that addresses the automation needs described. It combines various frameworks and libraries to achieve the outlined objectives. The actual implementation will require additional configuration for specific platforms (e.g., CRM, marketing tools).
Prerequisites

    Chatbot: Use frameworks like Rasa, Dialogflow, or GPT-powered bots.
    Document Portal: Use Flask for a secure web portal and integrate with PyPDF2 or Tesseract for document validation.
    Marketing Automation: Use APIs for Instagram (Instagram Graph API) and email campaigns (e.g., SendGrid).
    CRM Integration: Use platforms like Salesforce or HubSpot APIs.
